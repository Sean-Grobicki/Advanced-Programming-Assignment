# Advanced-Programming-Assignment

To run this program please download the scheduler folder and then run the marker.exe and then open the feedback pdf to see the different tests that the solution passed and the score the scheduler was given. All the information about the criteria for the program is in the context folder. We were tasked with first loading all the information from JSON, XML and database files to load the information for the scheduler. Then with the scheduler we were given a series of penaltys for inefficencies with the scheduler and then was graded based on how low a score it was compared to everyone elses scheduler. The specification for this assignment are within the Information folder. The classes which I programmed are the 3 Data Accessor Objects (DOA) and the Scheduler class. These are within the Scheduler/src/solution filepath which all included are the classes I programmed.
